I wasn't sure what to upload 
- when I tried to upload the entire project folder I got an error due exceeding the upload size limit

So... I've just uploaded the files I worked on, modified and/or created
- server.js - all my code eas written in here
- package.json - now includes dependacy for js-yaml (I used this for the bonus challenge)
- database.yml - a copy of the database yaml file

Hope this is OK.

Thanks.
